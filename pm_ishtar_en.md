# **The Chants of Ishtar**

The three hymns we reimagine in poetry have ancient roots: they are tied to the extraordinary figure of **Enheduanna** (ca. 2285–2250 BCE), daughter of **Sargon of Akkad**, founder of the first great Mesopotamian empire.

She is considered the **first known author in human history**, for her texts were signed and preserved with her name. Sargon appointed her **high priestess (en)** of the moon god **Nanna** in the great temple of Ur, a role with both religious and political weight: to unite Sumerian and Akkadian cults under one authority.

In that role, Enheduanna composed numerous hymns, most devoted to **Inanna** (later known in Akkadian as **Ishtar**). These hymns are not simple ritual texts: they are at once **mystical poetry, personal invocation, and political statement**.

### **Historical Context**

-   Mesopotamia of the third millennium BCE was a land of city-states (Ur, Uruk, Lagash, Nippur), unified by Sargon into the **Akkadian Empire**.
-   Sumerian remained the sacred and literary language, while Akkadian became the administrative and everyday tongue. Enheduanna wrote in **Sumerian**, though with Akkadian sensitivity.
-   Religious texts were inscribed on clay tablets in cuneiform and copied for centuries; it is thanks to this tradition that we still possess fragments and versions of her hymns.

### **The Hymns to Inanna / Ishtar**

1. **In-nin me-hus-a** – exalts the goddess as keeper of the _me_, the divine decrees ruling the cosmos.
2. **In-nin sa-gur-ra** – praises Inanna as the terrible goddess of war and storm.
3. **Nin-me-sara (Exaltation of Inanna)** – an extraordinary hymn where Enheduanna speaks in the first person, recounting her political and spiritual trials and entrusting herself to the goddess as her sole savior.

These texts are more than prayers: they embody a **vision of the divine feminine**, where the goddess is subject to no male god, but reigns with absolute power.

# **The Voice of the Priestess**

Many millennia ago, when the first cities raised brick towers toward the sky and rivers marked the borders of civilization, a woman dared to speak with the voice of the gods.
Her name was **Enheduanna**.

Clay tablets kept her song alive: not dry formulas, but visions, supplications, exaltations. In her hymns resounds the breath of one who speaks to a goddess as to a lover, a mother, a sovereign of war.

She turned with utter devotion to **Ishtar**:

-   lady of cosmic decrees, who holds the _me_ and governs universal order;
-   goddess of terrible powers, storm and flame that shake kingdoms;
-   supreme sovereign, the one who alone can hear the cry of mortals and transform it into song.

Now, in this poetic reimagining, the three hymns return as **Three Chants to Ishtar**:
a modern poem, faithful in spirit, carrying the priestess’s voice beyond time.

# **CHANT I – Ishtar Who Holds All Power**

O Ishtar, flame that will not die,<br/>
echo of stars that never decline,<br/>
you are the root that upholds the sky,<br/>
you are the river that feeds the vine.

No border stops you, no law restrains,<br/>
for in your womb eternal decrees remain:<br/>
the _me_, the measures, the cosmic thread,<br/>
woven before the dawn was spread.

You lift the seas with a single breath,<br/>
you bend the winds, you command their path,<br/>
you shape the fate of kings on thrones,<br/>
you loose the knots of forgotten songs.

Ishtar, lady of hidden hymn,<br/>
who walks through cities silent and dim,<br/>
who treads the deserts without a name,<br/>
who knows the seeds of the human flame.

All gods bow low before your light,<br/>
not out of fear, but pure insight:<br/>
for in your core they see the source,<br/>
the womb that gave their being course.

You are the chalice, you are the sword,<br/>
you are the balance, you are the storm,<br/>
you are the womb that guards the seed,<br/>
you are the fire that burns to feed.

When you speak, the stones awake,<br/>
when you smile, the blossoms break,<br/>
when you are silent, the world will wait<br/>
for the sign that tears the veil of fate.

The wanderers lost cry out your name,<br/>
the priests in temples sing your flame,<br/>
the tyrants fear you in their halls,<br/>
the sleepless poets hear your call.

O goddess who holds all power near,<br/>
let not my name be lost to the air,<br/>
let my voice remain in your breath,<br/>
let not my words dissolve in death.

I offer this hymn, this endless fire,<br/>
a song that never will expire:<br/>
for you alone are the origin,<br/>
and you alone are the end within.

Ishtar, boundless, without decay,<br/>
you are the night, you are the day,<br/>
you are the dawn that ever returns,<br/>
you are the flame that ever burns.

So ends my speech, but not your light:<br/>
for even silence sings in might<br/>
when you abide within its core,<br/>
forever present, forever more.

# **CHANT II – Ishtar of Terrible Powers**

Ishtar, you rise like a storm untamed,<br/>
eyes of fire, heart inflamed,<br/>
your tread shakes plains, your voice breaks stone,<br/>
your cry resounds, a thundered throne.

You are the thunder without release,<br/>
you are the spear that will not cease,<br/>
you are the wind that tears down gates,<br/>
you are the bolt that sunders fates.

The cities close at the sound of your name,<br/>
the towers sway, their stones aflame,<br/>
the nations tremble when you ascend,<br/>
clothed in fire, with steel to rend.

Ishtar, goddess of dread command,<br/>
you drink the blood of the battlefield’s sand,<br/>
you dance upon ashes where warriors fall,<br/>
you sing the song that conquers all.

Who dares deny you, surely dies,<br/>
who dares defy you, never survives,<br/>
who dares to love you, surely burns,<br/>
who dares to pray, in suspense returns.

You are the cry of the raging host,<br/>
you are the blade the heavens boast,<br/>
you are the night that devours kings,<br/>
you are the dawn no solace brings.

When you descend into sacred shrine,<br/>
the gods themselves with breath confined,<br/>
when you speak among the stars,<br/>
their light grows dim, their fire jars.

O goddess who knows not pity’s face,<br/>
grant those who serve you steadfast grace,<br/>
grant courage to the loyal heart,<br/>
grant strength to never fall apart.

But fool not those who dream in vain:<br/>
you give to those who bear the strain,<br/>
you break the bones of those who feign,<br/>
you topple thrones with but a flame.

Ishtar, your name is terror’s cry,<br/>
yet promise of victory burning high,<br/>
for in your fury shines the truth<br/>
that none may hide, not even youth.

I sing you trembling,<br/>
I call you blazing,<br/>
I serve you fearing,<br/>
I love you knowing.

May you be fire without end,<br/>
may you be war no peace can mend,<br/>
may you be flame that eats the land,<br/>
and ash that marks your sovereign hand.

Ishtar of terrible powers, arise:<br/>
you are the blade that never dies,<br/>
you are the goddess who cannot sleep,<br/>
you are the storm no hand can keep.

# **CHANT III – The Exaltation of Ishtar**

O Ishtar, radiance of light,<br/>
you sit enthroned in heavens bright,<br/>
I lift my song like a river wide,<br/>
seeking the ocean, seeking its tide.<br/>

You tore me free from shadow’s hold,<br/>
you clothed me in your fire of gold,<br/>
you made me part of your endless flame,<br/>
and now I speak in your own name.

Kings will tremble at your hand,<br/>
judges bow to your command,<br/>
even the gods incline their head<br/>
when through their halls your feet have tread.

You are not only storm and strife,<br/>
you are embrace, renewed life,<br/>
you are the secret, the hidden kiss,<br/>
you are the promise of future bliss.

When I bend before your name,<br/>
my fear dissolves, no trace remains,<br/>
when I breathe your living fire,<br/>
my heart is lifted, my soul inspired.

O Ishtar, sovereign of the skies,<br/>
none can match your boundless rise,<br/>
none can match your ruthless love,<br/>
none can match your strength above.

I saw you walk through mortal lands,<br/>
your gaze reflected in their hands,<br/>
I saw your eyes in mirrors deep<br/>
where human pain and longing sleep.

You walk the markets, the desert ways,<br/>
you hear the poor in their hidden days,<br/>
you laugh at the pride of the mighty throne,<br/>
yet guard the weak who call alone.

You do not forget, O flame divine:<br/>
you raise the fallen, you give them sign,<br/>
you feed the faithful, you guard their breath,<br/>
you pull them back from the grip of death.

I, so fragile, lift this song,<br/>
for without you, all is wrong,<br/>
without your light, all turns to dust,<br/>
without your presence, no hope, no trust.

You are the lady of starry night,<br/>
you are the mistress of dream’s delight,<br/>
you are the queen of time unchained,<br/>
you break the fetters, you loose the chains.

Ishtar, mother and judge severe,<br/>
goddess of love, destruction near,<br/>
hear my trembling, burning plea,<br/>
accept this prayer I give to thee.

I give my heart, I give my breath,<br/>
I give my life, my all till death:<br/>
for you alone are the way,<br/>
you alone are the destined day.

And when my flesh to dust shall fall,<br/>
and ashes answer the final call,<br/>
my name will dwell within your breath,<br/>
my song will shine beyond my death.

Ishtar, exalted above the rest,<br/>
glory none can bear or test,<br/>
be my eternal, guiding flame,<br/>
till the world’s last dawn shall proclaim.
