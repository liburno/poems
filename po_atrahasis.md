# Poem of Atrahasis 

The **Poem of Atrahasis** (also called the *Epic of Atraḫasis* or the *Flood Poem*) is an ancient Mesopotamian myth, written in Akkadian on clay tablets (around the 17th century BCE, Old Babylonian period). It is one of the main sources that tells of the creation of mankind and a great flood, similar to the one later found in the *Epic of Gilgamesh* and in the Bible.

In short:

* **The minor gods** were forced to work hard to maintain the universe. Tired, they rebelled.
* **Enki/Ea** then suggested creating humans, shaped from clay and divine blood, to take over the labor.
* Humans multiplied, made noise, and disturbed the supreme god **Enlil**.
* To reduce the population, the gods sent plagues and famines, but Enki helped Atrahasis (“the very wise one”) survive.
* Finally, Enlil decided to wipe out humankind with a **great flood**.
* Enki secretly warned Atrahasis and told him to build an ark to save himself, his family, and animals.
* After the flood, the gods regretted the destruction, and new rules were established to limit human growth (mortality, infertility, and figures such as consecrated priestesses who could not bear children).

It’s interesting because:

* It predates *Gilgamesh* and the biblical Genesis, and probably served as a source of inspiration for both.
* It shows the Mesopotamian view of humanity: created as servants of the gods.
* It has both an epic structure and a “political” dimension, since it tries to explain the existence of death, diseases, and sterility.

The **Poem of Atrahasis** has come down to us in a **fragmentary form**.

* **Original length**:
  It was composed of **three main clay tablets** (I, II, III), each with about 30–40 columns of text (roughly 100 lines per tablet). In total, around **900–1200 lines**.

* **What has been translated**:

  * **Tablet I** (the creation and the rebellion of the minor gods, up to the birth of humankind) is **almost complete**.
  * **Tablet II** (the multiplication of humans, plagues, famines) is **partially preserved**, with some gaps.
  * **Tablet III** (the flood and the new order of humanity) is **very fragmentary**, but the flood narrative has been reconstructed partly thanks to parallel versions in the *Epic of Gilgamesh* and later texts.

* **What has been lost**:

  * Many lines from Tablets II and III are **missing or illegible**.
  * The exact details of the **dialogue between Enki and Atrahasis** and the full description of the ark are not preserved.
  * We know the ending must have explained social and religious institutions (such as mortality, infertility, consecrated priestesses), but these parts survive only in fragments and parallels.

* **Surviving sources**:

  * Copies from the 17th century BCE (Old Babylonian period).
  * Later copies (Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods), which helped philologists fill some gaps.

In short: we have about **two-thirds of the poem** readable and translatable, while the last third survives only in fragments.

**ATRahASIS — TABLET I: THE MAKING OF MANKIND**

When heaven was young and the deep was asleep,<br/>
The silence was heavy, the waters were deep.

The stars were uncounted, their courses unplanned,<br/>
The clay had no footprint, no shovel, no hand.

The younger gods labored with sweat in their eyes,<br/>
They carved out the riverbeds under blank skies.

They raised up the embankments, they hammered the stone,<br/>
They groaned in the darkness and carried the load alone.

For seasons unending they cut through the plain,<br/>
They built up the levees through wind and through rain.

They shouldered the cosmos like oxen in trace,<br/>
They dug without mercy to fill up the space.

At night they lay breathless with dust in their lungs,<br/>
By day they were haunted by drum-beaten tongues.

A whisper grew louder, a murmur became flame,<br/>
They spoke what was nameless and dared it to name.

“Why serve without limit, and why must we bleed?<br/>
We plow for another who never knows need.”

Their torches were kindled; they dropped pick and blade;<br/>
They stood at the threshold where mandates are made.

They circled the house of the lord of the air,<br/>
Their anger a thunder, their patience laid bare.

Enlil sat in stillness, the mountain of might,<br/>
He felt their hot breathing surround him at night.

Anu looked from heaven, the high, distant throne,<br/>
Enlil in the lowlands, encircled and alone.

“Who stirred this uprising? Who loosened the rein?<br/>
What heart chose rebellion and taught them disdain?”

But Enki, the fathomless, keeper of streams,<br/>
Awoke in his chamber, where wisdom learns dreams.

He rose from sweet waters with counsel like dew,<br/>
His voice was a lantern; his words cut things true.

“O brothers,” he told them, “your labor is pain.<br/>
Let balance be re-fashioned; let mercy remain.”

“The burden is heavy; the harness is raw.<br/>
Let craft be our answer; let mind become law.”

“Not fire against fire, nor sword against shield—<br/>
Let life be the treaty that brings us to yield.”

“Let clay be the canvas; let blood be the dye.<br/>
Let breath be the secret we borrow from sky.”

“From earth and from spirit, a worker we’ll bind,<br/>
A being to carry the weight we’ve assigned.”

“Release then your fetters; step back from the yoke.<br/>
Let labor be human; let sleep visit folk.”

The council fell quiet; the torches burned low;<br/>
A new path was opening, tender and slow.

They summoned the Mother, Nintu of births,<br/>
Who sees in the darkness the seeds under earths.

“Mama of womb-rooms, arranger of cries,<br/>
Who measures the shadow that turns into skies,

Mix clay with our essence; mix water with fire.<br/>
Give shape to a creature of labor and desire.”

They chose from among them a god who could fall,<br/>
A knowing one, mindful, who carried the All.

Geshtu-e, the thinker, the pulse of their art—<br/>
They took him with sorrow and opened his heart.

His blood, like a river, ran warm into dust;<br/>
His mind was a whisper of duty and trust.

“Forgive us,” they said, “for the cost of this plan;<br/>
Through you, understanding will live within man.”

The Mother collected the red, sacred rain,<br/>
She kneaded the loam with a low, steady strain.

She sang over mixtures the night cannot break,<br/>
She circled the bowl for compassion’s own sake.

She whispered at thresholds where memory starts,<br/>
She braided the lifelines to cradle their parts.

The clay found a cadence beneath her slow hand,<br/>
A beat like a drum in a half-sleeping land.

She called to the womb-gods, fourteen in a ring,<br/>
Seven to daughter, seven to son, to bring.

“Hold this in silence; hold fast and be wide.<br/>
Let time be the midwife; let patience be guide.”

“Ten moons for the mystery; ten moons for the clay;<br/>
We measure the nightfall; we harvest the day.”

They waited while waters and dust learned their names;<br/>
They waited while sparks within darkness found flames.

The wombs moved like rivers that swell without sound,<br/>
The moon counted petals that opened around.

At last came the labor, the storm and the calm,<br/>
The heat and the cooling, the cradle and psalm.

The cords were all severed; the cries filled the shade;<br/>
The new ones were numbered; the covenant made.

The Mother wiped foreheads and painted their feet,<br/>
She lifted their eyelids to teach them to meet.

She gave them a language of gesture and fire,<br/>
A hunger for making, a furnace of desire.

She taught them the rhythm of furrow and field,<br/>
The handle of sickle, the heft of a shield.

She taught them the secret of water in beds,<br/>
The knowledge of channels and river-born threads.

The gods watched in stillness, a hush in their bones—<br/>
The weight they had carried now fell from their thrones.

The younger gods rested; they shared sacred bread;<br/>
The older gods nodded, their foreheads unled.

Enlil drew a boundary, a line through the air:<br/>
“The labor is human; the heavens are spare.”

“Let temples be raised where our names can be sung,<br/>
But let it be mortals who lift timber and rung.”

“Let offerings rise like the dew of first light;<br/>
Let smoke learn our doorways and sweeten the night.”

The first dawn of humans broke clean on the reeds;<br/>
The fields were awake with the whisper of seeds.

They learned how to fasten a roof against wind,<br/>
To braid mats of river-grass, supple and tinned.

They learned how to turn the wheel round on a pin,<br/>
To listen to barley, to thresh it to skin.

They numbered their children; they laughed at the rain;<br/>
They mended their sandals; they hardened their grain.

They opened canals with a patient, bright hand,<br/>
And water, delighted, ran lines through the land.

They built little altars of bread and of smoke,<br/>
They carried cool water to tamarisk oak.

They lifted their eyes with a question and song,<br/>
They wondered at thunder and what makes it strong.

They carved little tablets with stylus and mark,<br/>
They mapped out the seasons from dawn into dark.

They named every footprint they found in the silt,<br/>
They learned how to barter for wool, clay, and gilt.

The gods felt a warmth that they hadn’t yet known—<br/>
A hush full of humming, a seed fully sown.

But joy has its echo and echoes grow wide;<br/>
A chorus can rattle the night’s sacred hide.

As numbers kept climbing, the villages spread,<br/>
The laughter grew louder, the ovens glowed red.

The drum of the cradle, the hammer on stone,<br/>
The marketplace shouting, the flute’s rising tone—

All blended like river-sounds turning to roar,<br/>
A music that pressed on the threshold and door.

Enlil in his quiet felt pressure accrue,<br/>
A humming that gathered like storm-building dew.

He rose from his chamber and stepped into sky,<br/>
He measured the noise like a veil on his eye.

“What clamor is shaking the rafters of sleep?<br/>
What rustle of mortals grows high as the deep?”

Anu heard the question from far, far above;<br/>
He answered with distances, silence, and love.

“New life has a heartbeat, a drum of its own;<br/>
It rattles the rafters; it asks to be known.”

Enlil did not answer; he counted the sound,<br/>
He tasted its edges and weighed what he found.

“Balance must hold or the waters will climb;<br/>
Too many bright engines can shatter their time.”

But Enki, the listener, stirred in his streams,<br/>
He held both the noise and the sense of their dreams.

“Let mercy be measure; let patience be art;<br/>
Where noise is a river, we strengthen the heart.”

The younger gods rested beside their cool springs,<br/>
Relieved of the burdens and joyful at things.

They taught humankind how to carry the load,<br/>
How to read a horizon, and travel a road.

They showed them the sign for the underworld’s gate,<br/>
The rules for the threshing, the scales for the weight.

They taught them the order of months and their names,<br/>
The shine of the solstice, the wheel of sun-flames.

They taught them the omen in bird-shadow flight,<br/>
The meaning of rainfall, the hush before night.

They taught them the stories that anchor a town,<br/>
The way to lift timber and set it down.

The Mother of Mothers sat watching their play,<br/>
She smiled at the weaving of night into day.

She bound on their wrists little charms made of string,<br/>
For luck in the planting and hope at first spring.

She whispered to midwives the secrets of birth,<br/>
To keep every doorway a healing of earth.

She blessed every kiln with a breath through her teeth,<br/>
So jars would keep water in shadow beneath.

The new ones grew clever; they built up their walls;<br/>
They fashioned a doorway with lintels and calls.

They made little gardens; they brewed little beers;<br/>
They learned to keep memory beyond single years.

They taught one another to count and to share,<br/>
To trade their bright trinkets and polish their ware.

They learned how to bargain without drawing knives,<br/>
To settle disputes with the weighting of lives.

They found that the river remembers its path,<br/>
They found that the clay can be shaped from its wrath.

They found that the wind can be trapped in a sail,<br/>
They found that a promise is stronger than mail.

Enlil watched the surging like wheat on a hill,<br/>
The hum was a pressure, relentless and still.

He stood at the lintel between loud and calm,<br/>
He sought a cool measure, a balancing balm.

Enki brought counsel, a cistern of mind:<br/>
“Where voices are many, be just to their kind.”

“Where clatter is constant, let ritual rise;<br/>
Let cycles bring quiet; let structure be wise.”

“Let days be appointed for singing and feast,<br/>
And nights for the pillows where murmurs are least.”

“Let fields have a fallow; let women have rest;<br/>
Let men set aside what is too often pressed.”

“Let laws be a lattice, a ladder of light,<br/>
A pattern to soften the harshness of night.”

And so it was settled, for now, with a sigh;<br/>
The noise found a rhythm; the clamor ran dry.

But seasons keep turning; abundance will spread;<br/>
The grain that is golden will triple its head.

The cradles keep rocking; the bread-ovens burn;<br/>
The markets keep filling; the caravans turn.

The rivers are bridled with channels and locks,<br/>
The herds grow in number like stars over flocks.

The feasts grow more crowded; the songs scale the dome;<br/>
The drums learn a thunder that rattles the home.

A watcher can love it and still feel the strain,<br/>
For joy, when unmeasured, can sharpen to pain.

Enlil in the twilight surveyed what had grown,<br/>
The hum in his chambers now hardened to stone.

He spoke to the council, the high-gated ring,<br/>
Where Anu and Enki and great voices sing:

“My heart is not stingy; I favor their bread;<br/>
But balance is breaking; the beam bends ahead.”

“The waters are restless; the winds bear a load;<br/>
Too many bright footfalls are shaking the road.”

Enki sat in patience, his gaze on the floor,<br/>
He knew what was coming, the tightening door.

“Let caution be tempered by kindness,” he pled,<br/>
“Let remedies gentler be chosen instead.”

But counsel would circle, and measures be weighed,<br/>
And shadows of future began to cascade.

For now, there was quiet, a hush after storm,<br/>
A fragile arrangement, a tenuous form.

The gods took their places; the humans their tools;<br/>
The rivers ran silver through furrows and pools.

The Mother kept watch with a hand on the clay,<br/>
In case a new shaping was needed one day.

She wrapped up the night in a shawl stitched with stars,<br/>
She set little guardians on thresholds and bars.

She taught them a prayer that is humble and bright:<br/>
“Keep balance in daylight; keep mercy in night.”

She taught them to count not just measure of wheat,<br/>
But measure of kindness in markets and street.

She taught them to hold both the plow and the song,<br/>
To know when to linger and when to move on.

The younger gods slept and remembered the pain,<br/>
Then smiled at the absence of thunder and chain.

They dreamed of canals that they no longer bore,<br/>
Of mornings unburdened, of spades used no more.

They blessed every doorway where humans lay down,<br/>
They blessed every alley of humming-packed town.

They whispered to teachers and healers and scribes,<br/>
To lift up the lowly, to soften hard bribes.

They traced on the tablets the pacts that would hold,<br/>
They breathed on the ink so the letters grew bold.

The world was a garden of order and mess,<br/>
Of grief and of laughter, of cry and caress.

The clay remembered blood; the blood remembered clay;<br/>
In each was the other, by night and by day.

And all of this shimmered beneath a thin thread,<br/>
A balance that trembled above every head.

The council adjourned in the rose after rain,<br/>
With peace for a season, with promise and strain.

The Mother walked home through the hush of the reeds,<br/>
She gathered the fragments of future and seeds.

She tucked them in baskets beside her cool bed,<br/>
She leaned into silence and tilted her head.

“May harmony linger,” she breathed to the wall,<br/>
“But if it should falter, I’ll answer the call.”

The night crossed the rooftops with wings made of sleep,<br/>
The river kept whispering wisdom to keep.

The oxen were quiet; the lamps were all low;<br/>
The embers like fireflies decided to glow.

And over the houses of dust-born and god,<br/>
A shared, tender stillness lay easy and broad.

The sky held its breath like a parent at door,<br/>
Listening to children who murmur no more.

But deep in the rafters, a murmur remained,<br/>
A small, steady pulse that could not be contained.

Not storm, not rebellion, not fury or blade,<br/>
Just life in its rising, so bright and so made.

The world turned its shoulder and shifted its weight,<br/>
The hinge felt the pressure of motion and fate.

And somewhere, invisible, drafts of a plan<br/>
Began to grow questions as countless as sand.

For joy like a river will fill up its banks,<br/>
And call for a widening, or overflow pranks.

For now, there was mercy, and sleep without fear,<br/>
And gods who were grateful the load wasn’t near.

For now, there was singing and grain in the jar,<br/>
And footprints like constellations mapping how far.

For now, there was balance, an intricate braid,<br/>
And hands in the clay where beginnings were laid.

For now, there was blessing on threshing and bread,<br/>
A lullaby soft on each laborer’s head.

But balance is music that asks for attune,<br/>
And even sweet choirs can trouble the moon.

The Mother kept watch with her ear to the loam,<br/>
She knew how the pulse of a future can roam.

She smiled at the sleepers, at swaddles and rings,<br/>
At bracelets of copper, at everyday things.

She lifted her hands to the dome of the night,<br/>
She traced with her finger a promise of light.

“If ever the clamor grows hard to abide,<br/>
Let wisdom not harden; let mercy preside.”

“If ever the river runs high to the door,<br/>
Let love be the oar and compassion the shore.”

“If ever the count of the cradles is vast,<br/>
Remember the first one, remember the last.”

She folded her prayer like a garment well-worn,<br/>
And tucked it in dawn where new hours are born.

The gods fell to dreaming of cool, open springs,<br/>
Of wind in the reeds and of unburdened wings.

The people slept deeply, their tools by the wall,<br/>
Their names in the tablets, their breath small and small.

And thus ends the tablet of making and grace,<br/>
Where clay learned a heartbeat and found it a place,

Where gods put the pickaxe and shovel away,<br/>
And mortals were woven from blood into clay.

Where balance was brokered and labor re-sung,<br/>
And lullabies rose from a work-weary tongue.

Where mercy, inventor of delicate art,<br/>
Set humankind gently to carry its part.

Where silence returned to the chambers of might,<br/>
And peace like a shawl wrapped the bones of the night.

Sleep, little makers, while rivers run clear—<br/>
The next song is coming, and soon it’ll be here.

**ATRAHASIS — TABLET II: THE CLAMOR OF HUMANITY AND THE PUNISHMENTS**

The dawn kept returning, the seasons turned round,<br/>
The earth filled with children, their laughter the sound.

The villages blossomed, the ovens grew hot,<br/>
The markets grew crowded, the cradles would not.

They planted and harvested, hammered and sung,<br/>
Their flutes and their drumskins together were strung.

The gods in their chambers could hear the loud song,<br/>
A chorus unceasing, insistent and strong.

What once was a whisper, a murmuring thread,<br/>
Now thundered like rivers that leapt from their bed.

Enlil, the lord of the breath and the storm,<br/>
Awoke in disturbance, in anger and form.

“The clamor is endless, the racket too deep,<br/>
No silence for counsel, no quiet for sleep.

The humans are swarming, their numbers too vast,<br/>
Their shouting like tempests that shatter the mast.

If balance is broken, then order must speak;<br/>
I’ll scatter affliction, make famine grow weak.”

He summoned disease from the shadows of night,<br/>
He loosened the fever, the coughing, the blight.

The wells lost their sweetness, the fields turned to ash,<br/>
The cattle fell groaning, the fires lost their flash.

The people cried out to their gods in despair,<br/>
They lifted up incense, they lifted up prayer.

To Enlil they wailed, but his ear turned away;<br/>
His heart was a granite, unbending in sway.

But Enki, the friend of the hidden and weak,<br/>
Leaned close to Atrahasis, began then to speak.

“Listen, O wise one, O careful of mind,<br/>
A whisper I give you, a secret to bind.

Gather your people, instruct them in rites,<br/>
Appease Namtar, the herald of nights.

Bake bread for his spirit, pour beer at his feet,<br/>
Offer him reverence, petition him sweet.

If sickness is master, then kindness is key,<br/>
If hunger is raging, then sharing must be.”

Atrahasis obeyed, and the sickness withdrew,<br/>
The fever was quiet, the blight turned to dew.

The people recovered, their children grew strong,<br/>
The markets were noisy with barter and song.

But soon came abundance, and numbers again,<br/>
The noise like a hammer kept striking the plain.

Enlil in his chamber could not find his rest,<br/>
The cries of the mortals beat hard on his chest.

“Too many, too noisy, too heavy the sound,<br/>
Again I must strike them, again they’ll be bound.

This time let the rivers retreat from their beds,<br/>
This time let the famine put fire in their heads.

Let fields turn to emptiness, barns into dust,<br/>
Let hunger remind them of silence and trust.”

The barley was withered, the orchards were bare,<br/>
The bellies of children were hollow with air.

They gnawed on their sandals, they sucked at dry reeds,<br/>
They hunted the shadows for pitiful seeds.

The people cried out to the heavens once more,<br/>
But Enlil was hardened, he bolted his door.

Enki, the merciful, stirred in his sleep,<br/>
He whispered to Atrahasis, quiet and deep.

“Listen, O faithful, O sharp in the ear,<br/>
I’ll give you a counsel that famine may fear.

Call off the midwives, forbid them their art,<br/>
Close up the womb’s gate, make barren its part.

Let maidens be sealed, let mothers be few,<br/>
So famine won’t hollow their children like dew.

And honor the grain god with offerings true,<br/>
The furrows will soften, the barley will renew.”

Atrahasis obeyed, the wombs held their seed,<br/>
The hunger diminished, the earth gave its feed.

The rivers ran silver, the orchards grew sweet,<br/>
The famine retreated, abundance replete.

But soon the great houses were crowded again,<br/>
The children like locusts spread wide on the plain.

The gods in their councils sat heavy with care,<br/>
The hum of the mortals was filling the air.

Enlil rose in fury, his voice like a gale,<br/>
“No more will I listen, no prayer will avail.

Three times have I smitten, three times they’ve survived,<br/>
By Enki’s sly whisper they still are alive.

The time has now come for a cleansing more vast,<br/>
The flood shall erase them, a silence shall last.”

Anu in his heaven looked down with a sigh,<br/>
The weight of the sentence was heavy and high.

But Enki was silent, his mind like a stream,<br/>
Already he fashioned a path through the dream.

Already he pondered the ark and the wood,<br/>
Already he wondered if mercy still stood.

The gods sealed their counsel with oaths and with dread,<br/>
The tablets of fate on their lap were all spread.

The wind held its breath, and the waters grew still,<br/>
The plan of destruction was forged by their will.

But deep in the darkness, where secrets are sown,<br/>
Enki was plotting a mercy of stone.

He whispered to rushes, to reeds by the side,<br/>
He whispered to walls that could carry the guide.

“Atra-hasis, faithful, attend to my word,<br/>
Though sworn is my silence, my counsel is heard.

A flood will be rising, a storm without end,<br/>
But wisdom will guard you, as father and friend.”

---

**ATRAHASIS — TABLET III: THE FLOOD AND THE NEW ORDER**

The council was gathered, the sentence was sealed,<br/>
The doom of the mortals was fated, revealed.

Enlil in his anger declared with a roar,<br/>
“Let waters unbind, let the oceans outpour!

Let storm-clouds assemble, let thunder descend,<br/>
Let rain without measure bring all to an end.”

The gods sat in silence, uneasy of heart,<br/>
For mercy was banished, compassion apart.

But Enki, the trickster, the wise in the stream,<br/>
Prepared a soft whisper, a word wrapped in dream.

He could not speak openly, bound by the vow,<br/>
But walls have their ears, and rushes know how.

To Atrahasis he murmured in reed,<br/>
A counsel disguised as a wall’s urgent creed:

“Tear down your house, build a vessel instead,<br/>
Forsake every roofbeam, take timber and spread.

Shape her like sunrise, a hull round and tall,<br/>
Seal her with pitch so no water can call.

Take seed of all creatures, take beasts two by two,<br/>
Take bread for the journey, take family too.

When the storm is unleashed and the waters arise,<br/>
This ark will preserve you, a womb on the skies.”

Atrahasis obeyed with a craftsman’s fierce hand,<br/>
He cut cedar timbers, he measured the span.

His neighbors were mocking, “What madness you build?<br/>
What vessel so massive, what madness fulfilled?”

But hammer on timber was answer enough,<br/>
The pitch sealed the seams and the frame was made tough.

The dawn of the seventh day rose on the deck,<br/>
The vessel stood mighty, the gods’ great shipwreck.

He loaded provisions, he gathered his kin,<br/>
The animals entered, both scaled and with skin.

The birds in their cages, the cattle in stalls,<br/>
The seeds in their baskets, the grain in the halls.

The skies grew like iron, the winds shook the reeds,<br/>
The air split with thunder, the storm found its speeds.

The fountains of deep were unchained in a rush,<br/>
The heavens were opened with lightning and crush.

The rain fell unending, the storm without pause,<br/>
The rivers grew monstrous, defying their laws.

The people cried out, but their cries went unheard,<br/>
The waters erased them, their names were a word.

Mountains were swallowed, the cities were gone,<br/>
The flood was a tyrant, relentless and strong.

The gods themselves trembled, they cowered in fright,<br/>
They shivered like children, they wailed in the night.

Nintu the Mother, the womb of the clay,<br/>
Wept for her children, swept ruthless away.

“How could we decree this? What madness of hand?<br/>
The womb that I fashioned is drowned in the sand.

The mortals are vanished, their cries pierce my ear,<br/>
No incense, no offering, no laughter, no cheer.”

But the storm kept on raging, the sea was a wall,<br/>
Seven days, seven nights, till silence would fall.

The ark like a seed rode the belly of wave,<br/>
A cradle of life on a terrible grave.

When dawn broke at last and the storm-winds withdrew,<br/>
The ark touched a mountain, the waters grew few.

Atrahasis opened a hatch to the sun,<br/>
He loosed out a dove but it circled, found none.

He loosed out a swallow, it searched without stay,<br/>
But finding no resting, it too flew away.

He loosed out a raven, black shadow of night,<br/>
It fed on the waters and did not alight.

Then land was emerging, the peaks broke the foam,<br/>
The ark stood in stillness, the flood found its home.

Atrahasis descended, he kissed the dry land,<br/>
He built up an altar with stone and with hand.

He offered up incense, he offered up bread,<br/>
The smoke rose to heaven, the gods gathered, fed.

Like flies they encircled the savor so sweet,<br/>
Their hunger for offerings at last they could meet.

Nintu was weeping, her heart full of grief,<br/>
But Enlil was raging, his temper a thief.

“Who saved the mortal? Who spared them this fate?<br/>
Which god has betrayed me, undone my mandate?”

But Enki stepped forward, his voice like the deep,<br/>
“Wisdom is mercy, the seed we must keep.

If all are extinguished, who offers your name?<br/>
If none are remaining, what honor, what fame?

Better to temper, to measure, to bind,<br/>
Than empty the earth and unravel mankind.”

The council was silenced, the fury grew still,<br/>
The gods turned to reckon, to alter their will.

So rules were established to soften the strife,<br/>
New limits were placed on the measure of life.

“No longer unending shall mortals increase,<br/>
We temper their numbers with sickness and cease.

Some wombs shall be barren, some cradles be dry,<br/>
Some children shall falter, some early shall die.

Some women be priestess, in temple remain,<br/>
They’ll serve without bearing, a balance to gain.”

Thus humankind’s burden was tempered with death,<br/>
Their lives became fragile, a loan of each breath.

But spared was the lineage, the story, the song,<br/>
The ark had preserved them, their memory strong.

Atrahasis knelt with his head to the clay,<br/>
He thanked the kind waters for sparing his way.

The Mother gave blessing, the Father gave sign,<br/>
The rainbow of mercy was bent into line.

The fields would be tilled, though with sorrow and sweat,<br/>
The gods would be honored, their pacts never met.

But balance was brokered between earth and sky,<br/>
That humans might labor, and gods still be high.

And thus ends the tablet, the flood’s final chord,<br/>
Where wrath was a river, but mercy restored.

Where clay and divine found a boundary true,<br/>
A fragile agreement, forever renewed.
