# Epic of Gilgamesh

The _Epic of Gilgamesh_ is one of the oldest known works of literature in human history, originating from ancient Mesopotamia. It was written in Akkadian, using cuneiform script on clay tablets, and dates back to around 2100–1200 BCE, with the most complete version compiled in the 7th century BCE in the library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh.

The poem tells the story of Gilgamesh, the semi-divine king of Uruk, and his journey of friendship, heroism, loss, and the search for immortality. Central themes include:

-   **Friendship**: The deep bond between Gilgamesh and Enkidu, a wild man created by the gods to challenge him.
-   **Mortality and Immortality**: Gilgamesh’s quest after Enkidu’s death to find eternal life, which ultimately teaches him about human limits.
-   **Civilization vs. Wilderness**: Enkidu’s transformation from a creature of the wild to a part of human society.
-   **Human Condition**: The inevitability of death and the importance of living meaningfully.

The epic includes famous episodes such as the slaying of Humbaba, the Bull of Heaven, Enkidu’s death, the flood narrative (which parallels the Biblical Noah story), and Gilgamesh’s encounter with Utnapishtim, who survived the great flood.

The _Epic of Gilgamesh_ survives in several versions, but the most important and best-preserved is the **Standard Babylonian version** compiled by Sin-leqi-unninni around the 12th–11th century BCE. Here are the key details:

-   **Length**: The complete Standard Babylonian version would have been about **3,000 lines of poetry**, though only about **two-thirds** of the text is preserved.
-   **Tablets**: The Standard version was written on **12 clay tablets**.

    -   **Tablets I–XI** contain the epic narrative (from Gilgamesh’s arrogance, through Enkidu’s friendship and death, to Gilgamesh’s quest).
    -   **Tablet XII** is considered an appendix or later addition; it retells part of an older Sumerian tale in which Gilgamesh tries to summon Enkidu’s spirit from the underworld.

-   **State of preservation**:

    -   Tablets have been found in **fragments across Mesopotamia**, especially from the library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh (7th century BCE).
    -   None of the tablets are perfectly intact—most are broken, and some are missing entirely. Scholars have reconstructed the text by comparing multiple copies and versions (Babylonian, Assyrian, and older Sumerian stories about Gilgamesh).

-   **Lost and recovered material**:

    -   We are missing **hundreds of lines** (roughly one-third of the epic).
    -   Some passages are only partly legible due to cracks and erosion.
    -   However, new fragments are still being discovered, which sometimes fill the gaps. For example, in 2015, a new fragment of Tablet V was published, adding details to the battle with Humbaba.

-   **Reliability of translation**:

    -   The translations are considered **fairly reliable**, since Akkadian cuneiform is well understood.
    -   Still, because of missing lines and damaged tablets, some sections are reconstructed with educated guesses.
    -   Different scholars may choose slightly different words for poetic reasons, but the overall meaning and story are solid.

So: the epic was about 3,000 lines across 12 tablets, we have roughly two-thirds of it today, and while translations are trustworthy, the text is fragmentary and leaves some mysteries.

### Tablet I — Modern Verse

Sing of Gilgamesh, king of the land,<br/>
Two-thirds divine, yet bound by man’s hand.<br/>
He built Uruk’s walls, so strong, so high,<br/>
Touching the earth, yet reaching the sky.

Mighty in body, fierce in his pride,<br/>
None in the city could stand at his side.<br/>
Day after day he pushed men too far,<br/>
Claiming their sons, their brides, as they are.

The people cried out, their prayers were sent,<br/>
To heaven above, in their torment.<br/>
The gods took pity, and shaped from clay<br/>
A rival, a friend, to balance his sway.

From wilderness came one, untamed, unshorn,<br/>
Enkidu, beastlike, of nature born.<br/>
He drank with gazelles, in the field he ran,<br/>
Not yet touched by the world of man.

A hunter beheld him, feared his might,<br/>
Snares were broken, he fled from sight.<br/>
The hunter’s father whispered in dread:<br/>
“Go to the king, let Gilgamesh be led.”

Gilgamesh spoke: “Bring forth a charm,<br/>
A woman of grace, with beauty to disarm.<br/>
Through her embrace his wildness will fade,<br/>
The beast will be broken, a man remade.”

So Enkidu met her, by river’s side,<br/>
For six long days with her did he abide.<br/>
The beasts then fled, his bond was undone,<br/>
His heart turned toward the city of sun.

She spoke of Gilgamesh, king and lord,<br/>
Who ruled with strength, by will and sword.<br/>
Enkidu listened, his spirit stirred,<br/>
And so began the tale we heard.

---

### Tablet II — Modern Verse

Enkidu rose, no longer the same,<br/>
Tamed by love, yet burning with flame.<br/>
The woman spoke: “Come, see the square,<br/>
Uruk’s bright towers are waiting there.

Gilgamesh rules, unmatched, supreme,<br/>
Yet men whisper darkly of a tyrant’s dream.<br/>
He takes what he wants, his hunger unbound,<br/>
The cries of the people echo around.”

Enkidu heard, his spirit burned,<br/>
Toward the great city his footsteps turned.<br/>
But first he drank beer, he ate man’s bread,<br/>
Seven cups later, his wildness fled.

No longer beast, he washed his hair,<br/>
Anointed with oil, clothed with care.<br/>
He joined the shepherds, guarded the flock,<br/>
Fought off the wolves, the lions that stalk.

Word reached the king: “A stranger roams,<br/>
Strong as the gods, he threatens our homes.”<br/>
Gilgamesh rejoiced: “At last a foe,<br/>
A match for my power, a test to know.”

They met in the street, the gates of the town,<br/>
Both like storms, refusing to bow.<br/>
They clashed in fury, the earth did quake,<br/>
Uruk trembled at each strike they’d make.

At last Gilgamesh forced him low,<br/>
Yet in defeat, respect did grow.<br/>
They laughed together, their anger gone,<br/>
Two mighty spirits, joined as one.

Thus from that hour, brothers became,<br/>
Linked in courage, in glory, in fame.<br/>
And so began their daring quest,<br/>
To challenge the world, and face its tests.

---

### Tablet III — Modern Verse

In Uruk’s halls the bond was sealed,<br/>
Two friends united, strength revealed.<br/>
Yet Gilgamesh’s restless heart did yearn,<br/>
For deeds of glory, to which all turn.

He spoke to Enkidu, bold in his speech:<br/>
“Let us seek Humbaba, far out of reach.<br/>
Guardian he, of the cedar land,<br/>
Armed with terror, fierce in hand.

We shall cut the trees, bring back their prize,<br/>
Make everlasting our name in the skies.<br/>
Men will recall the path we take,<br/>
Our legend sung for future’s sake.”

Enkidu trembled, his voice grew low:<br/>
“To face that demon? You do not know.<br/>
Humbaba’s breath is fire and storm,<br/>
Sevenfold armor, a monstrous form.

The gods have set him, their sacred ward,<br/>
No mortal may challenge, none may afford.”

But Gilgamesh answered, with blazing eyes:<br/>
“Shall I live my life till memory dies?<br/>
Man cannot linger, death will come near,<br/>
Better to act than to live in fear.

If I should fall, my name will remain,<br/>
Written in stone, beyond time’s chain.<br/>
If I should win, the world will see,<br/>
That kings are forged by destiny.”

Together they went to the elders’ hall,<br/>
Seeking counsel, before the call.<br/>
The elders warned: “Your pride is vast,<br/>
Yet dangers loom, shadows are cast.

Let Enkidu guide you, wise in the wild,<br/>
Once he was savage, nature’s child.<br/>
May Shamash guard you, sun above,<br/>
And grant protection through his love.

Take with you armor, forged with might,<br/>
Weapons gleaming in holy light.<br/>
Honor the gods with prayer and bread,<br/>
And fortune may follow where you tread.”

So blessings were spoken, vows were made,<br/>
The path of heroes before them laid.<br/>
In Uruk’s streets the people cried,<br/>
As Gilgamesh and Enkidu stood side by side.

---

### Tablet IV — Modern Verse

The journey began at dawn’s first flame,<br/>
Through desert winds the heroes came.<br/>
To Cedar’s realm their path was bound,<br/>
Where Humbaba’s roars shake the ground.

Gilgamesh prayed to Shamash above:<br/>
“Guide my steps, protect with love.<br/>
Grant us courage, make clear the way,<br/>
Keep the darkness of terror at bay.”

Six days they marched, and seven at night,<br/>
Restless in dream, disturbed by fright.<br/>
Each dusk the king laid his head to sleep,<br/>
Visions came, dark shadows deep.

He woke with fear, his heart a storm,<br/>
But Enkidu read each dream’s form:<br/>
“Your visions speak of fortune’s hand,<br/>
Victory waits in Cedar land.

Though storms may rage and mountains quake,<br/>
The gods are with you, make no mistake.”

Again Gilgamesh dreamt of fire,<br/>
Lightning, thunder, wrath entire.<br/>
He woke in dread, but Enkidu said:<br/>
“Your dream is good, cast off your dread.

The fire you saw is Shamash’s flame,<br/>
It burns the foe, it lifts your name.”

At break of dawn they pressed ahead,<br/>
Across wild plains their courage fed.<br/>
By streams they washed, with oil anoint,<br/>
Sharpened weapons, made armor joint.

At last they neared the Cedar’s height,<br/>
Where shadows stretched and day turned night.<br/>
Gilgamesh trembled, his spirit weak,<br/>
Yet Enkidu strengthened him to speak:

“Forward, my brother, together we stand,<br/>
No fate can break the joined of hand.<br/>
If we must fall, then fall with fame,<br/>
If we prevail, the world knows your name.”

So with prayers and vows they trod,<br/>
Heroes bound for the forest of god.

---

### Tablet V — Modern Verse

Before them rose the Cedar land,<br/>
Sacred trees by gods’ command.<br/>
The forest loomed, its breath was fear,<br/>
Its silence heavy, shadows near.

They stood in awe, their courage tried,<br/>
But hand in hand they stepped inside.<br/>
The cedars towered, roots ran deep,<br/>
A realm where holy secrets sleep.

Humbaba roared, the mountain shook,<br/>
His voice a tempest, the earth forsook.<br/>
Armor of terror, sevenfold might,<br/>
He came to crush them, blind with fright.

Gilgamesh faltered, his heart grew still,<br/>
But Shamash sent a radiant will:<br/>
Winds from all sides, fierce and wild,<br/>
Pinned the monster, the gods beguiled.

Enkidu shouted: “Now strike true!<br/>
The moment is ours, his power subdued!”<br/>
Together they raised their gleaming swords,<br/>
Steel met flesh with sharpened words.

Humbaba pleaded, his terror shed,<br/>
“Spare me, O king, let me not be dead.<br/>
I’ll serve you faithful, build your halls,<br/>
Guard your gates, obey your calls.”

Gilgamesh wavered, mercy stirred,<br/>
But Enkidu answered with burning word:<br/>
“Trust not his tongue, his heart deceives,<br/>
Strike now, or forever grieve.”

So Gilgamesh struck, the blow was done,<br/>
Humbaba fell, his reign undone.<br/>
They cut the cedars, sacred wood,<br/>
Bound the logs as heroes would.

They carved a gate for Uruk’s wall,<br/>
A gift of triumph, told to all.<br/>
The forest wept, the mountains sighed,<br/>
But men rejoiced at the giant’s side.

---

### Tablet VI — Modern Verse

Back to Uruk the heroes came,<br/>
With cedar gate and shining fame.<br/>
The city rejoiced, the people sang,<br/>
Through every street their praises rang.

But Ishtar, goddess of love and fire,<br/>
Beheld the king with fierce desire.<br/>
She spoke: “Be mine, O Gilgamesh bold,<br/>
I’ll grant you riches, jewels, and gold.

Kings shall kneel, the world obey,<br/>
Your strength will rule both night and day.<br/>
Harnessed lions shall pull your car,<br/>
Storms will serve you, near and far.”

But Gilgamesh mocked her, his words were flame:<br/>
“Why should I join in your crooked game?<br/>
Your love is fleeting, cruel, and vain,<br/>
All who loved you were left in pain.

Tammuz you struck, and he was slain,<br/>
The shepherd you ruined, his flock in chain.<br/>
The stallion you cursed with whip and bit,<br/>
The lion you doomed, the hawk you split.

Why should I trust what none survive?<br/>
Your love devours, none stay alive.”

Ishtar raged, her heart ablaze,<br/>
She flew to heaven with furious gaze.<br/>
Before her father Anu she cried:<br/>
“Grant me the Bull, let vengeance ride!

If you refuse, I’ll shatter the dead,<br/>
Raise them in armies, let them be fed!”<br/>
Reluctant, Anu gave her the beast,<br/>
The Bull of Heaven, a deadly feast.

It stormed through Uruk, the earth was torn,<br/>
Fields were ruined, men forlorn.<br/>
Three hundred fell with a single breath,<br/>
The Bull brought famine, plague, and death.

Gilgamesh and Enkidu closed in fast,<br/>
They seized the horns, they held it fast.<br/>
Enkidu struck, the Bull was slain,<br/>
Its heart to Shamash they offered in pain.

Ishtar wailed on the city wall,<br/>
Cursing the heroes, damning them all.<br/>
Enkidu mocked: he hurled its thigh,<br/>
Straight at the goddess in the sky.

The people rejoiced, the city rang,<br/>
But doom in the shadows already sang.

---

### Tablet VII — Modern Verse

That night the gods held council high,<br/>
Their judgment thundered from the sky.<br/>
“Enkidu must fall,” stern voices said,<br/>
“For slaying the Bull, for Humbaba dead.

Though Gilgamesh is king and strong,<br/>
It is his friend who bore the wrong.<br/>
The price is set, the fate is sealed,<br/>
One must die, the bond revealed.”

Enkidu woke with a cry of dread,<br/>
A dream of shadows filled his head.<br/>
He told his brother: “The gods decreed,<br/>
That I must perish for our deed.

The dark house waits where none return,<br/>
Dust for food, and clay for urn.<br/>
Kings and priests are gathered there,<br/>
Silent shadows, cold despair.”

Fever struck him, his body weak,<br/>
Twelve long days he could not speak.<br/>
He cursed the gate they built from trees,<br/>
He cursed the trapper on bended knees.

He cursed the woman who tamed his heart,<br/>
Who led him from beasts, who played her part.<br/>
But Shamash heard, and sternly replied:<br/>
“Why curse the harlot, once your guide?

She gave you bread, she gave you wine,<br/>
She brought you friendship, love divine.<br/>
Through her you gained the brother you sought,<br/>
Leave her blessed, curse her not.”

Enkidu wept, his anger stilled,<br/>
But sorrow deep his spirit filled.<br/>
He turned to Gilgamesh, hand in hand,<br/>
“My brother, soon I’ll leave this land.

Do not forget me when I’m gone,<br/>
Remember our deeds, the battles won.<br/>
Grieve for me, friend, yet live your days,<br/>
Let Uruk speak of your lasting praise.”

So Enkidu lay, his strength undone,<br/>
The doom of the gods could not be outrun.<br/>
The earth grew still, his breath was fled,<br/>
The mighty companion of Gilgamesh was dead.

---

### Tablet VIII — Modern Verse

Gilgamesh cried with a voice of woe,<br/>
Over his brother laid low.<br/>
“Enkidu, friend, my heart, my guide,<br/>
Why did you leave me, why must you die?

The wild we tamed, the gods we faced,<br/>
Together our names the people praised.<br/>
Now you are dust, and I remain,<br/>
Alone to wander in grief and pain.

Hear me, elders, hear my cries,<br/>
Uruk, weep with grieving eyes.<br/>
Let men and women raise their song,<br/>
For Enkidu, the brave, the strong.

Let the plains lament, the rivers mourn,<br/>
The beasts of the field in sorrow torn.<br/>
The cedar forest remembers still,<br/>
The day we conquered the demon’s will.”

He wrapped his friend in robes of gold,<br/>
Like a bridegroom bright, though cold.<br/>
He placed him upon a splendid bed,<br/>
As if sleep had touched, not death instead.

He summoned craftsmen, jewelers, all,<br/>
To carve the statue, to raise the hall.<br/>
He offered treasures, poured out wine,<br/>
For gods above and gods divine.

At dawn he raged, at night he wept,<br/>
By Enkidu’s side his vigil kept.<br/>
Like a lion pacing, a mourning dove,<br/>
Crying to heaven, to gods above.

“For you, my brother, I beat my breast,<br/>
No joy remains, no peace, no rest.<br/>
The fate of man is cruel, I see,<br/>
And death has stolen you from me.”

---

### Tablet IX — Modern Verse

Grief consumed the mighty king,<br/>
No joy, no rest, no song to sing.<br/>
“For Enkidu lies in silent clay,<br/>
And I shall follow one dark day.

Must death take all, both weak and strong?<br/>
Is mortal life so brief, so wrong?<br/>
I will not yield, I’ll seek the one,<br/>
Who found eternal life undone.”

So Gilgamesh left his city’s wall,<br/>
Through deserts vast, through mountains tall.<br/>
He wandered clad in lion’s skin,<br/>
His face was worn, his heart within.

He sought Utnapishtim, far away,<br/>
The man who lived past death’s decay.<br/>
To learn the secret, the hidden key,<br/>
Of life unending, immortality.

He came to mountains, twin at the gate,<br/>
Where scorpion-men as guardians wait.<br/>
Their eyes were fire, their gaze was doom,<br/>
Their presence wrapped the world in gloom.

But seeing him, they bowed in awe,<br/>
Two-thirds divine was what they saw.<br/>
They warned: “The path is dark as night,<br/>
Twelve leagues of shadow, without light.

Yet if you dare, then pass within,<br/>
And seek the truth where none have been.”

Through endless dark he pressed alone,<br/>
No moon, no star, no light was shown.<br/>
Till sudden dawn broke fierce and clear,<br/>
He reached the garden bright and near.

Trees bore jewels, their fruit was stone,<br/>
Lapis and ruby, all brightly shone.<br/>
He gazed in wonder, yet still he yearned,<br/>
For deathless wisdom, still unlearned.

---

### Tablet X — Modern Verse

From the jeweled garden Gilgamesh came,<br/>
Still chasing life, still crying Enkidu’s name.<br/>
He wandered far till his weary feet<br/>
Brought him where sea and tavern meet.

There sat Siduri, of gentle face,<br/>
Keeper of wine in a lonely place.<br/>
She saw him torn, in lion’s hide,<br/>
A broken king with grief inside.

She barred her door, in fear she spoke:<br/>
“Why roams a stranger with heart so broke?<br/>
Your cheeks are hollow, your spirit wild,<br/>
What sorrow drives you, heaven’s child?”

Gilgamesh cried: “O woman wise,<br/>
Shall I not weep as my brother dies?<br/>
Enkidu sleeps in dust and stone,<br/>
And I must face the dark alone.

I seek Utnapishtim, across the sea,<br/>
The one who found eternity.<br/>
Show me the way, I beg, I plead,<br/>
Tell me the path, the hope I need.”

But Siduri sighed, her counsel plain:<br/>
“Why chase what none of man can gain?<br/>
The gods set death for mortal breath,<br/>
Life they keep, but man has death.

So fill your belly, dance and sing,<br/>
Cherish the joy that each day brings.<br/>
Hold your child, and kiss your wife,<br/>
This is the fate, the gift of life.”

Yet Gilgamesh turned, unmoved, unbowed,<br/>
“No rest for me, no joy, no crowd.<br/>
Until I find the hidden man,<br/>
I will not stop, I will not stand.”

Siduri relented, she gave her hand:<br/>
“To Urshanabi, the boatman, stand.<br/>
He serves Utnapishtim, across the tide,<br/>
But waters of death between you abide.

Break not the stones, but seek his grace,<br/>
He’ll guide your ship to that far place.”

Gilgamesh went, his fury burned,<br/>
He shattered the stones, the boatman spurned.<br/>
Yet Urshanabi, though grieved, agreed,<br/>
To build new oars for the hero’s need.

Together they set to the endless sea,<br/>
Toward the one who knew eternity.

---

### Tablet XI — Modern Verse

Across the sea they rowed with strain,<br/>
Through waters of death, through dark domain.<br/>
Till Utnapishtim’s shore they found,<br/>
The man whom gods to life had bound.

Gilgamesh spoke: “O wise, O true,<br/>
I crossed the sea to speak with you.<br/>
Death has taken my brother’s breath,<br/>
How can I flee the hand of death?

Tell me the secret, the way to live,<br/>
The gift the gods once chose to give.”

Utnapishtim sighed: “Why do you try?<br/>
No man escapes, all men must die.<br/>
But hear my tale, of flood and rain,<br/>
How once the gods cleansed earth with pain.

Enlil raged, their hearts decreed,<br/>
That mankind’s noise was a wicked seed.<br/>
They swore to drown the world entire,<br/>
A storm of wrath, of wind and fire.

Ea, my lord, in secret came,<br/>
Whispered to me, and spoke my name:<br/>
‘Build a vessel, strong and wide,<br/>
Take seed and life and kin inside.

Seal it tight with pitch and wood,<br/>
When storm arrives, you’ll brave the flood.’

I built the ark, I gathered all,<br/>
Family, creatures, great and small.<br/>
The storm unleashed, for days it roared,<br/>
Mountains vanished, the oceans poured.

Men turned to clay, the land was waste,<br/>
But in the ark we found God’s grace.

On the seventh day the storm grew still,<br/>
The sea was calm, the earth was ill.<br/>
I sent a dove, it flew, then back,<br/>
A swallow next, still no track.

A raven flew and found no need,<br/>
It did not return, the land was freed.

So I offered incense, bowed my head,<br/>
The gods grew gentle, their anger fled.<br/>
Enlil was furious—man had survived,<br/>
But Ea reproached him: ‘Be not so blind.

Send lions, wolves, or famine’s hand,<br/>
But not a flood to drown the land.’<br/>
Enlil relented, he touched my brow,<br/>
Immortal life was mine till now.”

Gilgamesh wept: “Then give to me,<br/>
What gods have given, eternity!”<br/>
But Utnapishtim spoke once more:<br/>
“Test yourself, six nights, seven days’ score.

Stay awake, if you can endure,<br/>
Perhaps your heart is strong, is pure.”

But sleep fell heavy, veiled his eyes,<br/>
For seven nights, no waking cries.<br/>
The wife of the sage then took her stand:<br/>
“Show him compassion, a gift from your hand.

Beneath the sea a flower grows,<br/>
Its thorns do cut, but life it shows.<br/>
If he should grasp it, bring it near,<br/>
His youth returns, his skin made clear.”

Gilgamesh dived, he seized the prize,<br/>
A secret bloom before his eyes.<br/>
He planned to share it, old made young,<br/>
For Uruk’s people, songs be sung.

But as he bathed, a serpent came,<br/>
It stole the flower, left only shame.<br/>
It shed its skin, renewed, reborn,<br/>
While Gilgamesh wept, defeated, forlorn.

He reached his city, vast and tall,<br/>
Beheld the strength of its mighty wall.<br/>
No life eternal was his to own,<br/>
But deeds endure, and names are known.

---

### Tablet XII — Modern Verse

Gilgamesh sat in his royal hall,<br/>
His heart still heavy with grief’s recall.<br/>
He thought of Enkidu, friend once near,<br/>
Whose voice was gone, no more to hear.

A gift of the gods was set in his hand,<br/>
A drum of cedar, from distant land.<br/>
Its sound would echo, fierce and clear,<br/>
But fate would twist, and loss draw near.

One day the drum fell deep below,<br/>
Into the realm where the dead men go.<br/>
Gilgamesh cried: “Who will descend,<br/>
To bring it back, my fallen friend?”

Enkidu’s shade rose, his vow was made:<br/>
“I’ll fetch the drum from death’s dark shade.<br/>
But heed my brother, these rules obey,<br/>
Or else the underworld will make me stay.

Wear not clean clothes, anoint not your skin,<br/>
Bring no weapons of bronze within.<br/>
Kiss not your love, nor strike your foe,<br/>
Call not aloud, make no show.

If you forget, then shadows bind,<br/>
And earth will clutch with hands unkind.”

But Enkidu strayed, the rules forgot,<br/>
The netherworld seized him, he was caught.<br/>
Gilgamesh prayed to the gods on high,<br/>
To Shamash, to Enlil, with tearful cry.

Ea relented, he made a way,<br/>
Enkidu’s ghost returned to stay—<br/>
But only a moment, pale and weak,<br/>
A shadow of life, too faint to speak.

Gilgamesh asked: “Tell me, my friend,<br/>
What do the dead endure, what is their end?”<br/>
Enkidu whispered, his voice was low:<br/>
“The rich, the poor, all there must go.

The man with sons sits proud, at ease,<br/>
The lonely one wanders with no peace.<br/>
Those left unburied drink bitter dust,<br/>
Their souls forgotten, devoured by rust.”

Then like smoke he drifted away,<br/>
Back to the realm where shadows stay.<br/>
Gilgamesh wept, his head bent down,<br/>
Still king of Uruk, still bound to crown.

### The Epic of Gilgamesh — Summary

**Tablet I–II: Gilgamesh and Enkidu**
Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, is two-thirds divine and one-third human. He is powerful but arrogant, abusing his people. The gods respond to the people’s cries by creating Enkidu, a wild man who lives among the animals. After being tamed through contact with a temple woman, Enkidu learns human ways. He challenges Gilgamesh, and after a fierce fight, they become close friends.

**Tablet III–V: The Cedar Forest and Humbaba**
Restless for glory, Gilgamesh proposes that they journey to the Cedar Forest to kill Humbaba, its terrifying guardian appointed by the gods. Despite Enkidu’s fears, they set out. Along the way Gilgamesh has troubling dreams, which Enkidu interprets as signs of future victory. With the aid of the sun god Shamash, they defeat Humbaba, who pleads for mercy. Enkidu persuades Gilgamesh to kill him. They cut down the cedars and fashion a great gate for Uruk.

**Tablet VI: Ishtar and the Bull of Heaven**
The goddess Ishtar proposes marriage to Gilgamesh, but he insults her, listing the tragic fates of her past lovers. Furious, she asks her father Anu to send the Bull of Heaven to punish Uruk. The bull causes devastation, killing many, but Gilgamesh and Enkidu slay it. Enkidu mocks Ishtar by throwing part of the bull at her. The gods decide that one of the two heroes must die for these offenses.

**Tablet VII–VIII: Enkidu’s Death**
The gods decree that Enkidu must die. He falls ill and dreams of the underworld, where all souls dwell in darkness. He curses those who led him away from the wild, but the god Shamash reminds him of the gift of friendship. After twelve days of suffering, Enkidu dies. Gilgamesh is devastated, mourning deeply and calling on all of Uruk to grieve.

**Tablet IX–X: The Quest for Immortality**
Unable to accept death, Gilgamesh sets out to find Utnapishtim, the one human granted eternal life. He travels through deserts, mountains, and total darkness, until he reaches the jeweled garden of the gods. He meets Siduri, a tavern-keeper, who tells him to abandon his quest and embrace life’s simple joys. But Gilgamesh refuses and seeks out Urshanabi, the boatman, who helps him cross the Waters of Death to reach Utnapishtim.

**Tablet XI: The Flood and the Plant of Life**
Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh the story of the Great Flood: how the gods decided to destroy humankind, but the god Ea warned him to build a huge boat, saving his family and animals. When the waters subsided, Utnapishtim offered sacrifice, and the gods granted him eternal life. To test Gilgamesh, Utnapishtim challenges him to stay awake for seven days, but he quickly falls asleep. Later, Utnapishtim’s wife urges him to show mercy, so he reveals a plant from the deep sea that can restore youth. Gilgamesh retrieves it, but on his way home, a serpent steals the plant, gaining renewal by shedding its skin. Empty-handed, Gilgamesh returns to Uruk and realizes his true legacy is the city’s enduring walls and culture.

**Tablet XII (Appendix): Enkidu’s Ghost**
In a later addition, Gilgamesh loses a sacred drum to the underworld. Enkidu offers to retrieve it, but breaks the underworld’s rules and is trapped. With divine help, his spirit briefly returns to Gilgamesh, describing the bleak fate of the dead. Then he departs forever.
